# TabList Change Log

## 1.0.0.1
### Changes and new features
* Added `ShowTabList` property. When set to `False`, the list of tabs is no longer displayed, and navigation can only occur via code.
* Added `AllowTabSelection` property. When set to `False`, the control can no longer gain focus, mouse hover effects are not displayed, and navigation can only occur via code. This allows you to disable navigation whilst still having the tabs visible.
